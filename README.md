# betterStats4GFFCompare
### Author: Daniel Kunk, 2025
Small script to extract counts for GFFcompare class codes and single/multi exon transcripts.

## gffcompare_qc.sh
This is a small tool to generate class code counts and also count single and multi exon transcripts from the files generated by running GFFcompare on a stringtie assembly RNAseq workflow.

## 1. Instructions
This script can be run as follows by running the script and passing the path to your .tmap file and your annotated.gtf file, both of which are generated by GFFcompare.

```
bash ./gffcompare_qc.sh \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.tmap \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.annotated.gtf
```
When an output file is not specified as is the case above, the stats will be written to a file called `stringtiecompare.qc_summary.txt` which will be placed in the directory where the .tmap and .gtf files are located. 

The output can be sent to stdout instead of a file as below.

```
bash ./gffcompare_qc.sh \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.tmap \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.annotated.gtf  -
```
Or it can be sent to a file of your chosing with the syntax below.

```
bash ./gffcompare_qc.sh \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.tmap \
    path/to/stringtiecompare.annotated.gtf \
    my_summary.txt
```

That’s it, the script needs only Bash and Awk to run. 

## 2. Output
The output file might look like something below.

```
=== gffcompare QC summary ===
Total transcripts          : 79 876
-----------------------------------
Class-code counts          ( =, j, u, … )
Code   Count
j      34 198
=      23 192
u       6 509
…

Mean transcript length by code (bp)
Code   MeanLen
=      2 015.4
j      1 432.7
u        998.7
…

Single-exon transcripts : 6 321
Multi-exon transcripts  : 73 555
```
- Class-code counts tell you how many transcripts perfectly match the reference (=), partially match (j, c), or are novel (u, x, etc.).

- Mean length by code flags tiny fragments or over-merged giants within each class.

- Single- vs. multi-exon totals help spot noisy, unspliced, or contaminated assemblies.
